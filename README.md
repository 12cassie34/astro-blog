## Overview

The blog has been constructed using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a comprehensive frontend framework that facilitates the creation of content-driven applications. 
I took guidance from the remarkable e-book titled "[Astro UI Framework](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-astro-ui-framework/)" authored by Emmanuel Ohans.

### What I learned
While in the process of development, I gained insights into:

- The concept of Astro components, along with distinguishing them from JSX.
- Exploring the various features that Astro brings to the table.
= Crafting CSS, HTML, and Markdown within an Astro application.
