## `worker_threads` Module in Node.js
- The `worker_threads` module in Node.js enables the use of **threads** that execute JS **in parallel**.
- The treads are useful for doing **CPU-intensive** JS operations.
- It is based on **the web works** that are available in browsers.
- The usage of `work_threads` makes us think about the usage of cluster. They allow the same structure, but they are slightly different.

### The difference between `worker_threads` and `cluster`
