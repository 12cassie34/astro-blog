## Scalability in Database
- There are two main strategies for scalability in databases: **vertical scaling** and **horizontal scaling**.

### Vertical Scaling
- It's about adding more capacity to a single database by incorporating additional devices and hardware components.
- The method is usually used in the relational databases.

### Horizontal Scaling
- Instead of adding more hardware, we just add more machines.
- One of the reasons that the document databases become popular is because they can do horizontal scaling.
