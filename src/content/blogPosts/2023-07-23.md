## Node.js
### Multiple Processes in Node.js
- Besides using `cluster` and `os` modules to handle the multiple processes, we can reach out to libraries to help us.
- One of the most popular libaries is PM2. 

### Useful PM2 Commands
- `pm2 delete server`: delete any running processes from the list of processes that PM2 tracks
- `pm2 start server.js -l logs.txt`: specify where to store our logs
- `pm2 start server.js max`: max the processes what we can run on a server
- `pm2 list`: list all processes we have
- `pm2 show <processId>`: checkout a process' detail, like heap size, heap usage, used heap size...etc
- `pm2 stop <processId>`: stop a process
- `pm2 start <processID>`: start a process
- `pm2 monit`: get a fancy process dashboard

#### **Zero Downtime Restart**
If we run a time sensitive service, and we make a change to our sever. We don't want users be blocked just because we have to restart our server to make an update.

So here comes the zero downtime restart.

With PM2, we can run `pm2 reload server` so that we can make sure there is at least one process is running. And other processes will be updated one by one.
